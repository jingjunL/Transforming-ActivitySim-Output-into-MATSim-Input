# ActivitySimMATSimCoSimulation
Python Script for transforming the output of ActivitySim (https://github.com/ActivitySim/activitysim) into the synthetic travel demand of MATSim (https://matsim.org/)

Relevant Paper for the script (would be happy if you can cite it in the case that you find this repository useful)

An Activity-and Agent-based Co-Simulation Framework for the Metropolitan Rotterdam The Hague Region(https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050925008609)

## How does this work?

ActivitySim is an open-source activity-based simulation software using discrete choice theory, which could provide excellent synthetic travel demand for the travel patterns of each individual within the study area during a typical day.

However, the output of ActivitySim (trip.csv) is based on Traffic Analysis Zone and hourly level,
Whereas in turn, cannot provide mesoscopic traffic assignment simulation.

MATSim is an agent-based mesoscopic traffic simulation software
